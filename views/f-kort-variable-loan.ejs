        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What Is an F1 Loan?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          An F1 Loan is a variable-rate mortgage where the interest rate is set once a year. The "F" stands for "flexible," and the "1" indicates that the interest rate is fixed for one year at a time. This loan is ideal for borrowers who are comfortable with fluctuating interest rates and desire flexibility in their loan terms. With an F1 Loan, you can adjust the loan term and switch between making interest-only and principal payments at regular intervals.

        <!-- Benefit 1 -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. High Flexibility</h3>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Variable Rates Offer Lower Starting Payments:</strong> Typically lower than fixed-rate loans at the time of origination.</li>
          <li><strong>Benefit Quickly from Rate Drops:</strong> Payments adjust annually, so you'll see payment reductions after a rate decrease.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Benefit 3 -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Regular Interest Rate Adjustments</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Stay Aligned with Market Rates:</strong> Annual adjustments ensure your loan reflects current interest rates.</li>
          <li><strong>Opportunities to Save:</strong> If rates decline, your payments decrease accordingly each year.</li>

      <!-- How Does the Interest Rate Work -->

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Does the Interest Rate Work?</h2>
        <!-- Interest Rate Setting -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Interest Rate Setting</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Adjustment Date:</strong> The interest rate is adjusted once a year, typically on January 1st.</li>
          <li><strong>Based on Refinancing Auctions:</strong> The rate is determined during annual refinancing auctions where the bonds funding your loan are sold to investors.</li>
          <li><strong>Market-Driven Rates:</strong> The interest rate reflects current market conditions at the time of the auction.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Important Considerations -->
      <div class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Important Considerations</h2>
        <!-- Variable Interest Rate -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Variable Interest Rate</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Payment Fluctuations:</strong> Your monthly payments can increase or decrease annually based on interest rate movements.</li>
          <li><strong>Financial Preparedness:</strong> Ensure you can handle potential payment increases if interest rates rise.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Limited Equity Protection -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Limited Equity Protection</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Minimal Equity Protection:</strong> The F1 Loan does not significantly protect your home equity during interest rate increases because bond prices are less affected when rates rise.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Refinancing -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Refinancing</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Annual Refinancing:</strong> The loan is refinanced annually when the underlying one-year bonds mature.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost of Refinancing:</strong> You may incur costs associated with refinancing, such as fees or a price deduction (<em>kursfradrag</em>).</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Repayment Conditions -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Repayment Conditions</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Non-Callable Loan:</strong> The loan cannot be refinanced at par value outside of refinancing periods.</li>
          <li><strong>Early Repayment:</strong>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
              <li><strong>Market Price Buyback:</strong> Repay the loan at any time by purchasing the underlying bonds at the market price, which could be higher than the remaining loan balance.</li>
              <li><strong>At Refinancing:</strong> You can terminate the loan at par value (<em>kurs 100</em>) with notice in connection with the annual refinancing.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Tax Implications on Gains:</strong>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
              <li><strong>Taxable Gains:</strong> If the loan's price at disbursement is over 100 (<em>kurs over 100</em>), any gain is taxable.</li>
              <li><strong>Offsetting Costs:</strong> Loan costs can be deducted from the taxable gain.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Interest-Only Options -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Interest-Only Options</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Total Limit of 10 Years:</strong> You have up to 10 years of interest-only periods throughout the loan term.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexible Timing:</strong> You can choose when to use your interest-only periods, adjusting during annual interest rate adjustments.</li>
        </ul>
