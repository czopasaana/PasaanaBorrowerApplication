        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What Is an Adjustment Loan?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          An Adjustment Loan is a type of variable-rate mortgage where the interest rate is fixed for agreed-upon intervals, typically every 3 or 5 years. After each period, the interest rate is adjusted (<em>rentetilpasning</em>) to reflect current market rates. This loan is suitable for those who desire short-term rate security but are open to adjustments that could lower their payments if interest rates fall.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Key Features</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <li><strong>Fixed Interest Periods:</strong> Lock in your interest rate for periods like 3 or 5 years. Generally, the longer you fix the rate, the higher the initial interest rate.</li>
          <li><strong>Periodic Interest Adjustments:</strong> At each adjustment period, your interest rate will be updated to the current market rate.</li>
          <li><strong>Interest-Only Option:</strong> Possibility to opt for up to 10 years of interest-only payments during the loan term.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility with Repayment:</strong>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
              <li><strong>Add or Remove Interest-Only Periods:</strong> You can choose to start or stop interest-only payments at each interest adjustment.</li>
              <li><strong>Adjust Loan Term:</strong> Opportunity to change the loan duration during an interest adjustment, up to a maximum of 30 years.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Quarterly Payments:</strong> Payments are made four times a year.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Benefits -->
      <div class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Benefits of an Adjustment Loan</h2>
        <!-- Benefit 1 -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Combination of Stability and Flexibility</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Fixed Rates for Set Periods:</strong> Enjoy predictable payments during each fixed-rate period.</li>
          <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Adjust your loan to suit changing financial circumstances at each interest adjustment.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Benefit 2 -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Potential for Lower Payments</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Benefit from Falling Rates:</strong> If interest rates decrease, your payments will automatically be reduced after the adjustment.</li>
          <li><strong>Manageable Increases:</strong> If rates rise, your payments will increase, but the fixed periods provide time to plan.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Benefit 3 -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Interest-Only Payment Options</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Financial Flexibility:</strong> Lower your payments for up to 10 years by paying only the interest.</li>
          <li><strong>Adjustable:</strong> Add or remove interest-only periods during interest adjustments, up to a total of 10 years.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Benefit 4 -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Loan Term Adjustments</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">

      <!-- How Does It Work -->

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Does It Work?</h2>
        <!-- Interest Rate Setting -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Interest Rate Setting</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Initial Rate Fixing:</strong> At loan issuance, the interest rate is fixed for your chosen period (e.g., 3 or 5 years).</li>
          <li><strong>Periodic Adjustments:</strong> After each period, the rate adjusts to the current market rate for the next interval.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Underlying Bonds -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Underlying Bonds</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Shorter Bond Terms:</strong> The bonds funding your loan have shorter terms than the loan itself.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular Refinancing (<em>Rentetilpasning</em>):</strong> When these bonds mature, they are replaced, and the loan's interest rate is adjusted accordingly.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Costs Associated with Adjustments -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Costs Associated with Adjustments</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Rate Adjustment Fee:</strong> You pay a price deduction (<em>kursfradrag</em>) when the loan undergoes an interest adjustment.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Repayment Flexibility -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Repayment Flexibility</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Interest-Only Options:</strong> Decide whether to pay down the principal or only the interest during each adjustment period.</li>
          <li><strong>Loan Term Changes:</strong> Modify the length of your loan during adjustments, within the maximum allowed term.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Important Considerations -->
      <div class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Important Considerations</h2>
        <!-- Variable Interest Rate -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Variable Interest Rate</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Potential Payment Fluctuations:</strong> Be prepared for changes in your monthly payments due to interest rate adjustments.</li>
          <li><strong>Economic Planning:</strong> Ensure your budget can accommodate potential increases in payments.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Limited Equity Protection -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Limited Equity Protection</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Modest Home Equity Protection:</strong> Adjustment Loans offer limited protection of your home equity because the bond prices do not significantly decrease when interest rates rise.</li>
          <li><strong>Market Sensitivity:</strong> Understand that your remaining debt may not reduce as much as with other loan types if rates increase.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Repayment Conditions -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Repayment Conditions</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Non-Callable Loan:</strong> The loan cannot be refinanced at par value outside of adjustment periods.</li>
          <li><strong>Early Repayment:</strong> You can repay the loan by purchasing the underlying bonds at market price, except in the last two months before an interest adjustment.</li>
          <li><strong>Possible Higher Repayment Amount:</strong> The repayment amount might exceed the remaining loan balance.</li>
          <li><strong>Termination at Adjustment Time:</strong> The loan can be terminated at par value (<em>kurs 100</em>) with two months' notice before an interest adjustment date.</li>
          <li><strong>Taxation on Capital Gains:</strong> Any capital gain from repaying a cash loan (<em>kontantlån</em>) may be subject to tax.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Tax-Free Payouts over Par -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Tax-Free Payouts over Par</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>No Tax on Initial Gains:</strong> If the loan is disbursed at a price above par (over <em>kurs 100</em>), any initial gain is not taxable because it's a cash loan.</li>
        </ul>
