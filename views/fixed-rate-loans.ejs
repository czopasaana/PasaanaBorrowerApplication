        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What Is a Fixed-Rate Bond Loan?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          A Fixed-Rate Bond Loan is a mortgage where the interest rate remains constant for the entire duration of the loan, which can be up to 30 years. This means your monthly payments are consistent, making it easier to budget and plan your finances.

        <!-- Benefit 1 -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Fixed Interest Rate Throughout the Loan Term</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Your interest rate is locked in, protecting you from market fluctuations.</li>
          <li><strong>Predictability:</strong> Consistent payments make budgeting easier.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Benefit 2 -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Up to 10 Years of Interest-Only Payments</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Financial Flexibility:</strong> Lower your monthly payments for a period by paying only the interest.</li>
          <li><strong>Choice of Timing:</strong> Opt for the interest-only period at the start or add it later.</li>
          <li><strong>Decision Point:</strong> When taking out the loan, you must decide if you want the option for interest-only payments.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Benefit 3 -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Protection of Home Equity if Interest Rates Rise</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Equity Preservation:</strong> As interest rates rise, bond prices fall, potentially reducing your remaining debt if you choose to repay.</li>
          <li><strong>Strategic Advantage:</strong> You can capitalize on market conditions to protect or enhance your equity.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Benefit 4 -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Repayment Options</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>At Par Value (Kurs 100):</strong> Repay the loan at its original value with two months' notice to a payment date, regardless of current bond prices.</li>
          <li><strong>Market Price Buyback:</strong> Repay at any time by purchasing the underlying bonds at the current market price, which may be lower if interest rates have risen.</li>
          <li><strong>No Tax on Capital Gains:</strong> You are not taxed on any potential gains from repaying the loan below par value.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Funding the Loan:</strong> Bonds are issued in the financial market to fund your mortgage.</li>
          <li><strong>Your Payments:</strong> Cover both interest and principal (unless in an interest-only period), repaying the bond investors.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- No Need for Refinancing -->
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">No Need for Refinancing</h3>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Lower Interest Rate:</strong> Refinance to reduce your rate and monthly payments.</li>
          <li><strong>Consider Increased Debt:</strong> Refinancing might increase your remaining debt due to costs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-2"><strong>If Interest Rates Rise:</strong></p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <li><strong>Reduce Remaining Debt:</strong> Buy back bonds at a lower market price, decreasing your mortgage balance.</li>
